# introduction_to_unit_testing_with_the_google_test_framework

## Description

This repository contains code examples to demonstrate unit testing with the google test framework. They are part of my presentation "Introduction to unit testing with the GoogleTest framework". The first example demonstrates the idea of unit testing and the other examples demonstrate how this can be done efficiently with GoogleTest.
